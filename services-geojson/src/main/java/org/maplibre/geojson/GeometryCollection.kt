/**
 * A GeoJson object with TYPE "GeometryCollection" is a Geometry object.
 *
 *
 * A GeometryCollection has a member with the name "geometries". The value of "geometries" is a List
 * Each element of this list is a GeoJson Geometry object. It is possible for this list to be empty.
 *
 *
 * Unlike the other geometry types, a GeometryCollection can be a heterogeneous composition of
 * smaller Geometry objects. For example, a Geometry object in the shape of a lowercase roman "i"
 * can be composed of one point and one LineString.
 *
 *
 * GeometryCollections have a different syntax from single TYPE Geometry objects (Point,
 * LineString, and Polygon) and homogeneously typed multipart Geometry objects (MultiPoint,
 * MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon) but have no different semantics.  Although a
 * GeometryCollection object has no "coordinates" member, it does have coordinates: the coordinates
 * of all its parts belong to the collection. The "geometries" member of a GeometryCollection
 * describes the parts of this composition. Implementations SHOULD NOT apply any additional
 * semantics to the "geometries" array.
 *
 *
 * To maximize interoperability, implementations SHOULD avoid nested GeometryCollections.
 * Furthermore, GeometryCollections composed of a single part or a number of parts of a single TYPE
 * SHOULD be avoided when that single part or a single object of multipart TYPE (MultiPoint,
 * MultiLineString, or MultiPolygon) could be used instead.
 *
 *
 * An example of a serialized GeometryCollections given below:
 * <pre>
 * {
 * "TYPE": "GeometryCollection",
 * "geometries": [{
 * "TYPE": "Point",
 * "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0]
 * }, {
 * "TYPE": "LineString",
 * "coordinates": [
 * [101.0, 0.0],
 * [102.0, 1.0]
 * ]
 * }]
 * }
</pre> *
